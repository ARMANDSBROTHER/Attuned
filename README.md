# Attuned
A chill, personal project attempting to create an iTunes replacement. Built using C# and Winforms.
In particular, I wanted something with the same smart playlist functionality that could sync with my android phone.

Currently not even in alpha yet.


## Main (planned) features
- Compatibility with their Library.xml.
- Ability to sync to any device with a filesystem. i.e. will be Android compatible.


## Eventual features
- Editing file properties and saving to xml
- Ability to create smart playlists
- drag and drop addition of files/albums

## May happen
- Coexistence with regular iTunes by editing .itl file
- Media Player
- Album Art
- Grid view

# Stages of Developement
1) Decode XML and show all data in a gui - In Progress
2) Enable syncing to Android and the like
3) Enable creation of smart playlists
4) Enable editing of values and xml for iTunes re-import
5) Enable adding of new tracks/albums
